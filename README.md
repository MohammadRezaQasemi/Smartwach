# Arduino Smartwatch

## Introduction
In this project I designed an smartwatch based on ATmega 328p and programmed via Arduino IDE. The watch includes all the primary features e.g. alarm, date/time, temprature. It also can receive and show notification from apps (Instagram, Twitter, Whatsapp, etc.) but you need to install _Notiduino_ and confiure the apps you want to receive notification.You can see [Catalog](https://github.com/qasemii/Smartwach/blob/master/Catalog.pdf) for the detailed information.
